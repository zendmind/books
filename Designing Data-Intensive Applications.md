# Designing Data-Intensive Applications

## CHAPTER 1 Reliable, Scalable, and Maintainable Applications

Many applications today are *data-intensive*, as opposed to *compute-intensive*. 

A data-intensive application is typically built from standard building blocks that pro‚Äê vide commonly needed functionality.

- Store data so that they, or another application, can find it again later (*databases*)
- Remember the result of an expensive operation, to speed up reads (*caches*)
- Allow users to search data by keyword or filter it in various ways (*search indexes*)
- Send a message to another process, to be handled asynchronously (*stream processing*)
- Periodically crunch a large amount of accumulated data (*batch processing*)
