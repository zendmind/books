## General Information

### File Reference Style

| Style        | Description    |
| -------  | -----   |
| Relative to Project |	The reference is a relative path to the project folder.
| Absolute Path | The reference is an absolute path.
| Relative to Reference Folder |	The reference is a relative path to a custom reference folder defined by the project.

### Notesï¼š
>- If a reference can not be found, the reference is drawn in red in the user interface. A reference that is not found will almost always cause a build to fail. One of the few exceptions is the build folder of a project as this folder can be dynamically build.
>- When the path for a reference is not directly visible in the user interface, it can be found via a tool tip.
